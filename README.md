# Machine Learning Classification of Urban Bike-Sharing Users

This project explores binary classification of user types (member vs. casual) in an urban bike-sharing system using multiple machine learning models. The goal is to predict user types based on trip behavior, time, and bike type features. Models used include logistic regression, classification trees, and SVM.
